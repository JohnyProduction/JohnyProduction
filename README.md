## 👨‍💻 About me

As a Computer Science Engineer and graduate of the Cracow University of Technology, I am transitioning into a Fullstack Developer role with a special focus on the .NET and React ecosystem. My professional background in R&D Cybersecurity gives me a unique advantage in the software development market: I don't just write code that works; I write code that is secure by design.

Currently, I work as an R&D Cybersecurity Engineer, where I research and implement innovative security solutions directly into systems using C# and .NET technologies. This experience has honed my ability to build robust backend architectures while adhering to strict standards like NIST and OWASP. Simultaneously, I am passionate about frontend development, creating dynamic user interfaces using React.js and modern JavaScript to ensure a seamless user experience.

My technical expertise spans the full development lifecycle, including database administration with SQL, API integration, and system maintenance. I am a highly motivated engineer who thrives in collaborative environments, constantly eager to learn new technologies and share knowledge with my team. I am now looking for opportunities to leverage my blend of programming skills and security mindset to deliver high-quality web applications.
